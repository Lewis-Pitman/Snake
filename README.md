 Snake game written in c++. WASD is used to control the snake. Collect all the fruits without colliding with your tail or the borders of the grid to win! (Please keep in mind this is one of the first projects I've worked on, so code quality and organisation may not be the best)

 Features:
 - Ability to change size of grid
 - Ability to change framerate
 - Collision detection with fruits, borders of grid and tail of snake
