BUG: TAIL IS WORKING BUT STRUGGLES WHEN TURNING CORNERS (I.E. UP + RIGHT, RIGHT + DOWN ETC)

add a score system and display once the game is over

screen width times height - 1 = maximum amount of fruits. have a counter count this up. once the count = max then we know the player has won the game 

for the tail, either find a way to minus 1 from the memory or do something else

possibility for multiplayer?? 2 snakes trying to eliminate each other (like slitherio or something) with the tail length increasing
